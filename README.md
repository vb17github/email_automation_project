# email_automation_project
This Java project is an email sender application that reads data from two Excel files: an email template file and a data file. The application uses the Apache POI library to read and write Excel files, and the JavaMail API to send emails. The user can select the email and data files using file chooser dialogs. The data file is processed and used to populate the email template. The resulting email is then sent to the recipients specified in the data file. The project also includes functionality to create progress and status labels, as well as exception handling for errors during file processing and email sending.
